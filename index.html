    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>Born in the heart of Michigan, this is the state’s only heavy metal festival built by fans, for fans.

It’s a weekend where the Michigan metal community comes alive, where newcomers and lifelong fans stand side by side, horns high, celebrating the music that fuels our souls. Whether you’re here for the legends, the local heroes, or the chaos in between, this is your home. This is pure Michigan metal.</p>
